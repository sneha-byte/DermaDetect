Skin Cancer Classification Web Application

Designed to help users detect the likelihood of malignant skin cancer using advanced machine learning techniques. The frontend was built using React and Tailwind CSS and the backend used a Python Flask API to process the uploaded image and communicate with the machine learning model. The model is a 
convolutional neural network trained on a dataset of skin lesion images to classify the likelihood of malignant skin cancer.
